** 1. Information **
SAVEPASS is a program that essentially saves username and password for airheads
like me who often forgets her usernames and passwords 10 seconds after
registering them. 
* Note that the set of website/application name, username, password, and any
* additional information user provides will be collectively called an entry *

** 2. How it works **
On the first screen, user has the option to save entry or to recall the
entries that they saved previously. 
- To save entry: follow program instructions to enter which
  website/application/ platform user is saving, their username, 
  their password, and any additional information they would like the program 
  to remember.
- To recall entry: follow program instructions to request an entry from 
  program's database

** 5. Security **
The program uses internal drive memory and has no capability to send entry to 
any other party. You can trust it 100%.
